# plant_disease_cleaning_and_validating


SETUP 


`pip install -m requirments.txt`

FOR LINUX:
`python3 clean.py`

FOR WINDOWS:
`python clean.py`


That way the cleaned data will be outped into a new folder called **sanitized**.
This data can then be used as you wish.

You can always check the Jupyter file to check for the data validation steps.
